# Form Validation App

## About
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is my Week 1 project for the Celebal Summer Internship 2025. I've built a form validation app using React to showcase my understanding of form handling and user input validation.

**Note:** This project was assigned by Celebal Technologies as part of the CSI - Celebal Summer Internship 2025.

## What I've Built
- A clean, user-friendly form interface
- Real-time validation feedback as you type
- Support for different types of input validation (email, phone, text)
- Error messages that actually make sense
- A responsive layout that works on all devices

## How to Run This Project

### What You'll Need
- Node.js installed on your computer
- A code editor (I used VS Code)
- Basic knowledge of the terminal

### Steps to Run
1. First, clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/form-validation-app.git
```

2. Open your terminal and go to the project folder:
```bash
cd form-validation-app
```

3. Install the required packages:
```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the app:
```bash
npm start
```

That's it! The app should open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

## Testing
I've included some basic tests to make sure everything works as expected. Run them with:
```bash
npm test
```
